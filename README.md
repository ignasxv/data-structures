## Introduction

This repository is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures by implementing them from scratch. Each data structure is designed with clear, well-documented code and is accompanied by practical examples showcasing how and where it can be applied.

## Features

- **Implementation from Scratch**: Each data structure is implemented without relying on built-in libraries to ensure a deep understanding of its mechanics.
- **Use Case Demonstrations**: Practical examples are provided to illustrate how each data structure can be used in real-world scenarios.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Clear and concise documentation to help understand the implementation and usage.

## Data Structures Included

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps**
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
- **Tries**

## Use Cases

Each data structure comes with examples demonstrating its application in various scenarios, such as:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (using arrays and heaps)
- **Graph Traversal** (using graphs)
- **Expression Evaluation** (using stacks)
- **Caching Mechanisms** (using hash tables)
- **Priority Queuing** (using heaps)

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-from-scratch.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd data-structures-from-scratch
```

## Usage

Each data structure is contained within its own directory. To explore and use a specific data structure, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the respective README file.

For example, to explore the implementation of a binary search tree:

```bash
cd trees/binary-search-tree
```

Run the provided examples:

```bash
python example.py
```
